  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    Atleast
    10 of them gaurding the hanger door. Typical.

    

    Could try punching
    my way through or Sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.

    

    What
    should I do?

    1. Take them head on- rush the 10 gaurds.

    2. Sneak my
    way to the emergency exit.'
