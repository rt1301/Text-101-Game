Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.
Atleast 10 of them gaurding the hanger door. Typical.

Could try punching my way through or Sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.

What should I do?
1. Take them head on- rush the 10 gaurds.
2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.
